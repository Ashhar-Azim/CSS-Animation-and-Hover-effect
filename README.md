HTML Animation Readme
This repository contains an HTML document, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file that together create a mesmerizing animation. The animation consists of spinning colorful circles that change their appearance when hovered over. This README provides an overview of the files and how to use them.

Files
1. index.html
This is the main HTML file that renders the animation. It includes the necessary structure, such as the HTML5 document structure, meta tags, and a reference to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. style.css
The CSS file contains the styling for the HTML document. It defines the appearance of the main container, under container, and the animated spinning circles. It also includes media queries to adjust the circle size and container dimensions for smaller screens.

3. main.js
The JavaScript file includes a simple console.log statement to indicate when the script is executed. This file may serve as a starting point for adding more interactivity or functionality to the animation.
